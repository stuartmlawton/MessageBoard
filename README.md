This is an implementation of the training project developed in the following training course:
"Building a Site with Bootstrap, AngularJS, Asp.net, EF and Azure" by Shaun Wildermuth.
PluralSight.

The standard solution is altered here and there to test (by breaking) a few of the trickier concepts and to align with version changes since the course release date.

To sum up, only about 3% of this code is bespoke... the broken bits and snarky comments mainly!

Licensing:
The code is a handwritten implementation of a course. The code is not a licensed product. 
The bugs are mine, the good stuff isn't. You are directed to pluralsight for the good stuff.
The bootstrap template was provided as part of the course download. I have .gitignored it.
